I am Joco, 26 years old self taught Web Developer based in Liverpool,UK.

I am a hard working person and a technology enthusiast who likes to creat
modern, good looking webpages that are also superfast. I am highly motivated
to continuously improve my skills and to grow professionally.
My primary focus is Front-end Development at the moment, but
I would like to become a Full-stack Developer in the future.

Programming is all about creating, building, solving problems these are the reasons
why I love what I am doing.
I spend most of my free time learning, improving my skills, but I also like
hanging out with my friends, going to gym, reading, or watching a good movie.

Technologies I know: HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJS, Sass, Styled Components, Git, Webpack,
Firebase, Gatsby and graphGL.
